EU4 Trade Visualizer
====================

Not satisfied with the way Europa Universalis IV only presents its trade data in numerical form, I made this tool to load
EU4 saves, read their trade data and produce a map that shows the values of all trade nodes and trade routes visually, 
by drawing circles and arrows of sizes and widths corresponding to their magnitudes. 

If you're not interested in the code and you are on Windows, you'll just want to download [this zip](https://github.com/Junuxx/tradeviz/raw/master/dist/tradeviz.zip). 

For more information and support, check out the [thread on Trade Visualizer on Paradoxplaza](https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/trade-routes-visualizer.718964/) (thread is only visible if you have an account and registered EU4).
