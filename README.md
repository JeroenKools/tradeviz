EU4 Trade Visualizer
====================

Unhappy with the way Europa Universalis IV only presents its trade data in numerical form, I made this tool to load
EU4 saves, read their trade data and produce a map that shows the values of all trade nodes and trade routes visually, 
by drawing circles and arrows of sizes and widths corresponding to their magnitudes. 

Note that the name Europa Universalis IV, its world map, trade network and the merchant icon are intellectual property 
of Paradox Development Studio or derived from it, and the included GPL3 license does not extend to these resources. 
They are only included in this piece of software under the assumption of fair use, and I do not claim any rights or ownership.
